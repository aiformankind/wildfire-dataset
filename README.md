Open Wildfire Smoke Datasets

The goal is to curate wildfire smoke datasets to enable open sharing and ease of access of datasets for developing vision based wildfire detection models. Easy access and open sharing of datasets will facilitate and accelerate the research efforts in solving wildfire crisis.
